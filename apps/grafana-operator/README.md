# grafana-operator

[grafana-operator](https://github.com/grafana-operator/grafana-operator) for Kubernetes to manage Grafana instances and grafana resources.

![Version: 0.1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.1-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: v5.3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-v5.3.0-informational?style=flat-square)

## Installation

This is a OCI helm chart, helm started support OCI in version 3.8.0.

```shell
helm upgrade -i grafana-operator oci://ghcr.io/grafana-operator/helm-charts/grafana-operator --version v5.3.0
```

Sadly helm OCI charts currently don't support searching for available versions of a helm [oci registry](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/11000).

## Development

For general and helm specific development instructions please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Out of scope

The chart won't support any configuration of grafana instances or similar. It's only meant to be used to install the grafana-operator.
Deployments of grafana instances using the CRs is supposed to be done outside of the chart.

Currently the plan is not to support networkpolicy. The operators support os diverse configuration that you have to support all options.
It's easier to just manage this configuration outside of the operator.
