## Configuration

## Installation

Sample installation is shown below. Includes a port forward to allow 
UI access. 

```
argocd app create cloudbeaver \
 --repo https://github.com/rahularram1999/argocd-examples-clickhouse.git.git \
 --path apps/cloudbeaver \
 --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace clickhouse
argocd app sync cloudbeaver 
kubectl port-forward svc/cloudbeaver -n ch 8978:8978

Once the server is running you may configure the editor and provide 
a password for the default cbadmin account.
