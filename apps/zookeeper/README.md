## Installation

Sample installation is shown below.

 --path apps/zookeeper \
 --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace ch

## Additional notes

The manifest is based on an [example single-node ZooKeeper

provided by the Altinity K8s operater. Production deployments should
have 3 nodes.
